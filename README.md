# oldmusicdatabase

This is an old music database project I completed as part of the final of my Database Design course, and is admittedly
a few years old. The idea was to provide a resource for people interested in reading about/listening to music and
provide them the navigation/GUI necessary to do so. From a home page, the user had access to a links, browse, and articles
section. The browse section was the most fully-formed; users could look at an individual release, or at an artist's
particular releases.

There was an additional admin page that (if you were allowed access) allowed one to add/remove/edit articles, releases,
etc. The site also featured a variety of custom CSS stylesheets that could be remembered by the browser via cookies.

The SQL commands will no longer execute, as I have lost access to the server on which they originally moved through,
but I would like to eventually rewrite the tables as they would have existed, purely for understanding for myself and
anyone else interested. I will create an 'issue' and leave it open until I can do this.
